# The Book
Mostly just going through the rust documentation book.
[The book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
Also using [Rust by example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) instead of getting the coding answers directly from the book - as their examples usually just show the entire solution in the rust way of doing things before actually learning the basics of syntax and whatnot.
